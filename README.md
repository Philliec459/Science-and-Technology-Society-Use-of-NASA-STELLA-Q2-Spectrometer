# Science-and-Technology-Society-Use-of-NASA-STELLA-Q2-Spectrometer

The Science and Technology Society (STS) of Sarasota-Manatee Counties Florida is working with the NASA STELLA (Science and Technology Education for Land/Life Assessment) outreach program as a part of our STEM initiative. NASA STELLA instruments are portable low-cost do-it-yourself (DIY) instruments that support science education, and outreach through scientific engagement, inquiry, and discovery while helping you understand Landsat better.

The NASA STELLA-Q2 can make 18 different measurements from violet/blue portions of the electromagnetic spectrum out to near infrared regions (beyond our range of vision). More can be found on the STELLA DIY instruments at the following link.
